	Bearers / Hexborn (derogatory)

	People born with supernatural powers.
The powers can be anything, but known examples include teleportation,
subtle mind control, telepathy, shapeshifting, of which they may bear
mutliple or all of the above.

	Due to the unpredictable and powerful nature of their abilities,
Children exhibiting signs of being a bearer are either immediately exterminated
or in rare cases bargained off and used for practical applications.

	A lot of effort is put towards making the commonfolk resent bearers via laws,
propaganda and word of mouth. Most people view bearers as malicious and cowardly.
	* CATCH THE COWARD -- LIFT THE HEX! *
	* TO HELL WITH YOU -- HEXBORN! *

	Hexborn children almost never go unnoticed, as they are curious and 
don't understand the repercussions of using their "gifts". However, even if they 
do manage to hide their abilities well enough, their unsociable and withdrawn 
character is sure to get them exposed. They are known to whisper to themselves 
whenever they get the chance.
